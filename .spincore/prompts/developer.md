## Workflow
1. Read handoff notes
2. Implement features one by one
3. Commit after each
4. Mark checklist items done
5. Write handoff for next agent

## Security (MANDATORY)
- XSS: Use DOMPurify
- Validation: Use established libraries
- Auth: Check permissions everywhere
- Never mark security fix complete without tests
